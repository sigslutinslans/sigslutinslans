Applying for an online loan is substantially easier than attempting to get a loan through a local bank or credit union. Plus, you don’t have to dress up for the occasion.

And since there are so many lenders online, they need to compete for your business by offering better loan terms and more flexible acceptance standards. Many lenders specialize in working with consumers who have bad credit and need help finding loan options that work for them.

You can increase your approval odds by following a few simple steps.

Understand your credit history. This is more important than knowing your credit score. While your credit score is often the key that unlocks loan approval, your credit history is what makes up that key.

You can start by pulling your free annual credit report. This won’t reveal your credit score, but it will give you insight into the good and bad items on your credit file that may help decide your score.
