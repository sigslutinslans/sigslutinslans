The internet age has altered a lot of things — including the popular definitions of some words. By definition, the word instant means immediate.

If you follow that definition, there would be no such thing as an instant loan. You can’t submit an application and have the money in your account before the button on your mouse bounces back up.

Instead, instant loans provide near-instant loan decisions. In most cases, you can determine your loan application status within seconds.

With an instant approval loan, you can submit your prequalifying form to a lending network, including those listed above, and the network will then send your form to all of its partner lenders. Each direct lender uses an automated underwriting system to accept or decline your application.
